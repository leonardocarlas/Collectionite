Collectionite was a startup: gathering datas from [cardmarket](https://www.cardmarket.com/it), it was offering

-  financial services, allowing users to track prices of their card collections
-  social services, helping collectors to trade their cards and to complete their collections
  
The team composed by Leonardo Carlassare, Thomas Porro, Nicol√≤ Cervo, Lorenzo Poletti and Riccardo Ottaviani developed it from July 2020 to May 2021. The site was up and running for a while but we had to stop developing it because of academic commitments.
For this reason we decided to make the project free and open source with the hope that one day someone will be able to complete and deploy it.
